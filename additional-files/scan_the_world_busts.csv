Antisthenes (about 450-370 BC) came to be regarded as the founder of the Cynic school of philosophy. Cynic means 'dog-like', and the name refers to the unworldliness of Antisthenes and his followers. Diogenes of Sinope, who made his home in a barrel, was a follower of the Cynic school.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Antisthenes died in 370 BC. This image appears to have been created - perhaps on the basis of an earlier portrait - in Pergamon (Pergamum), a Greek city of Asia Minor, in the late third or early second century BC. The wild hair, ragged beard, arched eyebrows, furrowed brow, prominent nose and hooded deep-set eyes are all features of a generalized philosopher type developed for the library of Pergamon, capital of one of the great Hellenistic dynasties. Features indicative of a specific individual were overlaid on this general type. The Pergamon Library portraits were much copied in the Roman period. This one was found with copies of others near the Via Appia outside Rome.</p>

An inscription within the hollow base of the bust identifies both sitter and artist: MAGisteR IOHANES MAGistRI . ANTONII DE SancTO MINIATE DOCTOR ARTIVM ET MEDICINE . MCCCCLVI. In the centre are the words: OPUS ANTONII.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Giovanni Chellini da San Miniato (d. 1462) was well-known in Florence as a doctor and teacher of medicine. The present bust was probably based on a mask cast from the doctor's face a few years prior to his death.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The bust was presumably commissioned by Chellini himself, and stayed in his family until it was sold in Florence in the second half of the nineteenth century. Chellini treated the sculptor Donatello for an illness, and in payment Donatello gave him a bronze roundel of the Virgin and Child in 1456, which is now also in the V&amp;A collection and displayed nearby to the bust.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This sculpture is one of the earliest and finest Renaissance portrait busts and is the earliest known work by Rossellino. It epitomises both his mastery of carving and the taste for life-like portrait busts that developed in Florence around this time. Made six years before the sitter died, the extraordinary handling and particular features of the bust indicate that it is based on a life-mask. A plaster mould was taken of the sitter's face, which would faithfully record his or her features. During the process, a band was placed around the sitter's head to protect the hair, and in the process the ears would be pinned back. However, this feature would not have been directly translated into an image cast from the mould, and in any event need not have been translated into the carved marble. To ensure his own fame and that of the sitter, Rossellini signed it underneath.</p>

There it belonged to a figure, portraying a wineskin-carrier, in a group showing the blinding of Plyphemos by Odysseus and his men. The Sperlonga grouo, dating to the 1st century AD, is a copy of an earlier Hellenistic original of around 200 BC.

Unlike his two immediate predecessors, Trajan and Hadrian, Antoninus did not embark on any major wars or travel widely through the Empire. Indeed, he was in effect the last emperor to spend most of his reign in the city of Rome itself. Regarded as a just and diligent administrator, Antoninus presided over the Empire at the height of its power&mdash;a time that the historian Edward Gibbon later famously referred to as the period when &ldquo;the condition of the human race was most happy and most prosperous.&rdquo;</p>",Marble,,

<p>The bust was purchased in Italy in 1848 by Eugene Piot and passed through the collections of Paul van Cuyck, Charles Timbal and Gustave Dreyfus, before entering the National Gallery of Art with the Andrew Mellon Collection. Traditionally ascribed to Donatello (1386-1466), the attribution to Desiderio, first suggested by Perkins in 1869, is now generally accepted. The bust is dated to 1455-60 because of stylistic analogies with the putti on Desiderio's Marsuppini tomb of c. 1453-60 in S. Croce, Florence (of which a cast, museum no. 1891-129, is in the V&amp;A's collections), and with the Blessing Christ Child of S. Lorenzo Tabernacle of 1461.</p>
<p>Desiderio da Settignano, (Desiderio de Bartolomeo di Francesco detto Ferro (c. 1428 or 1430 &ndash; 1464) was an Italian sculptor active during the Renaissance. <br />He came from a family of stone carvers and stonemasons.

This unprecedented contact with cultures far and wide disseminated Greek culture and its arts, and exposed Greek artistic styles to a host of new exotic influences. The death of Alexander the Great in 323 B.C. traditionally marks the beginning of the Hellenistic period.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">During the first half of the third century&nbsp;B.C., smaller kingdoms broke off from the vast Seleucid kingdom and established their independence. Northern and central Asia Minor was divided into the kingdoms of Bithynia, Galatia, Paphlagonia, Pontus, and Cappadocia.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hellenistic kingship remained the dominant political form in the Greek East for nearly three centuries following the death of Alexander the Great. Royal families lived in splendid palaces with elaborate&nbsp;banquet halls&nbsp;and sumptuously decorated rooms and gardens. Court festivals and&nbsp;symposia&nbsp;held in the royal palaces provided opportunities for lavish displays of wealth. Hellenistic kings became prominent patrons of the arts, commissioning public works of architecture and sculpture, as well as private luxury items that demonstrated their wealth and taste.&nbsp;Jewelry, for example, took on new elaborate forms and incorporated rare and unique stones. New precious and semiprecious stones were available through newly established trade routes. Concurrently, increased commercial and cultural exchanges, and the greater mobility of goldsmiths and silversmiths, led to the establishment of a&nbsp;koine(common language) throughout the Hellenistic world.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Hellenistic art is richly diverse in subject matter and in stylistic development. It was created during an age characterized by a strong sense of history. For the first time, there were museums and great libraries, such as those at Alexandria and Pergamon. Hellenistic artists copied and adapted earlier styles, and also made great innovations.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">A growing number of art collectors commissioned original works of art and&nbsp;copies of earlier Greek statues. Likewise, increasingly affluent consumers were eager to enhance their private homes and gardens with luxury goods, such as fine bronze statuettes, intricately carved furniture decorated with bronze fittings, stone sculpture, and elaborate pottery with mold-made decoration. These lavish items were manufactured on a grand scale as never before.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This bust is therefore most likely a king who wanted to show off his wealth by having someone sculpt a portrait of himself.&nbsp;</p>

Herms, the rectangular pillars surmounted by a head of Hermes, are first attested during the last quarter of the sixth century B.C. They were used primarily as boundary markers and guardians of entrances and thoroughfares. In the fifth century B.C., other deities such as Zeus were also represented in herm form and the monuments were used for a wider variety of functions. It is not possible to identify the god represented here. The elaborate hairstyle consisting of two long braids coiled around the head and held in place by a flat band is often found on images of Zeus or Poseidon. The eyes are a classical depiction of ancient cypro-attic art.&nbsp;</p>",Limestone,,

The hairstyle does not match those of Augustus, whose drooping eyebrows more closely framed the eyes. Nor does the portrait resemble those of any of Augustus&rsquo;s grandchildren: Caius, Lucius Caesar, and Agrippa Postumus. Clearly executed after Caius&rsquo;s death in 4 A.D., the face represented can therefore only be that of Germanicus, Livia&rsquo;s grandson, who married Agrippina the Elder, Augustus&rsquo;s granddaughter, in 5 A.D.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span id=""selection_index14""></span>Between his adoption by his uncle Tiberius in 4 A.D. and the death of Augustus ten years later, Germanicus frequently accompanied Augustus on military campaigns. During this period, portraits like this one proliferated. The piece can be dated to this time, between 8 and 10 A.D. (as can the heads in the British Museum 1883 and 1884, the Munich Residenz, and the Louvre Ma 3135). Cast aside by Tiberius after 14 A.D., Germanicus would only begin to be represented again, posthumously, as of 19 A.D.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span id=""selection_index15""></span>Three hairstyle types are granted to Germanicus; the &ldquo;B&eacute;ziers,&rdquo; &ldquo;Gabii,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Corinto-Stoccarda&rdquo; types. K. Fittschen has pointed out the similarities between the &ldquo;Corinto-Stoccarda&rdquo; capillary features and certain hairstyles worn by Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius, which would make the &ldquo;Corinto-Stoccarda&rdquo; a posthumous type just like the &ldquo;Gabii&rdquo; type.<a href=""http://ancientrome.ru/art/artworken/img.htm?id=4970#n001"" name=""t001"">1</a>&nbsp;But this concurrence seems unlikely, since another type, the &ldquo;B&eacute;ziers&rdquo; type, is still evident in 23 A.D. Therefore Fittschen determined that portraits of the &ldquo;Corinto-Stoccarda&rdquo; type are not in fact of Germanicus. The Louvre&rsquo;s new acquisition thus reinforces a type that poses a fundamental problem in the chronology of portraits of Germanicus.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span id=""selection_index16""></span>In its current state, this male head appears as a mask consisting simply of the face and the front of the neck. The back of the sculpture was cut away on three planes: a vertical or occipital plane, a nearly horizontal or summit plane, and an oblique or right temporal plane. Beneath the Adam&rsquo;s apple, the neck has been broken along three lines. Traces of polychromy have survived in the hair, particularly in the hollows of the locks on the right side of the head and above the left eye. The polychromy consists of a calcium carbonate mixed with red ochre, typical of mineral pigments. Traces of paint on the eyes were observed during the restoration.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span id=""selection_index17""></span>Roman-era heads originally constructed out of several pieces are quite an enigma. The hair, lips, eyes, and clothing were most often given a coat of paint to conceal joints and fillings, offsetting any aesthetic drawback of making the heads out of several pieces. The technique was the result of economic, social, and technical factors: sculptors, mostly Greek artisans both poorly paid and ill-considered in Rome, found the cost of raw materials too high to be able to abandon large pieces of marble. It is also likely that in an attempt to divide labor, actual portraits were sculpted by a specialist, while the hair was made by a younger or less talented workman from one or two pieces already added to the head. An unsuccessful portrait was therefore not of any great consequence.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;""><span id=""selection_index18""></span>It has been suggested that this portrait could be of the&nbsp;velato capite&nbsp;type known to include two portraits of Germanicus. Yet here the bond lines are not symmetrical: the line above the left temple does not correspond to the one on the right. Joined surfaces were crafted in a different manner. Originally, the top of the skull was set on a join bed studded with small recesses. Following an accident, the back of the head had to be planed down to attach a piece with a mortise; the top of the skull, now loose, was reattached with the same system. A shock to the right temple probably required the attachment of a third element, which was simply glued, possibly in the modern era. This second accident probably caused the irregular break around the neck. A third mishap may have led to the head being abandoned and, later, to all the additions being removed.</p>",Marble,,

His sitter holds a nosegay of flowers to her bosom in a very romantic pose; she is shown to below the waist, including her two hands, implying interaction with the viewer. This innovation was clearly not lost on Verrocchio's pupil, who would exploit its potential as well as its luminosity in his painted portrait. Indeed the sitter of this bust has sometimes been identified as Ginevra dei Benci, the subject of a Leonardo portrait. However, although withoit proof, it is generally assumed she is Lucrezia Donati.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Lucrezia Donati was one of the mistresses of the Medici, perhaps, one of Lorenzo the Magnificent's who had the longest tenure. She is immortalized here by Verrocchio as Woman with a Bouquet. An absolutely extraordinary work in particular because, and this is what the Florentines admired the most, the beauty of her hands. They have this jointless quality, or one that transcends joints; Botticelli would immortalize the same qualities in his painting. It should not be forgotten that Botticelli and Verrocchio were very friendly.</p>

Having got rid of the Emperor Gordianus III (ruled 238-244), Philip became head of state; it was during his reign, in 247, that Rome celebrated its millennium. The Emperor is depicted wearing a tunic and toga, the straight folds of which do not convey any sense of the texture of the fabric; short notches convey the hair and beard, while the facial features are generalized; there is no fine modelling on the surface. Yet this rough weather-beaten face must be a true likeness in the traditions of Roman portraiture. The asymmetry of the features gives the expression a sense of liveliness, combining will and cruelty with suspicion and hidden fear. The simplified and expressive plastic language appeared in Roman art under the influence of the barbarian provinces and was in keeping with the tastes of the new rulers of the Empire.</p>",Plaster cast of marble original,,

The holes meant the blood would drain away as water flowed from the vessels. Water was an important theme in Mesopotamian mythology, represented particularly by the god Enki and his acolytes. This table also displays the remarkable skills of Elamite metalworkers.</strong></p>
<p style=""font-size: 12.1088px; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">The table, edged with two serpents, rested on three sides on five figures that were probably female deities. Only the busts and arms of the figures survive. The fourth side of the table had an extension, which must have been used to slot the table into a wall. The five busts are realistic in style. Each of the deities was holding an object, since lost, which was probably a water vessel, cast separately and attached by a tenon joint. Water played a major role in such ceremonies and probably gushed forth from the vessels. Along the sides of the table are sloping surfaces leading down to holes, allowing liquid to drain away. This suggests that the table was used for ritual sacrifices to appease a god. It was believed that men were created by the gods and were responsible for keeping their temples stocked and providing them with food. The sinuous lines of the two serpents along the edge of the table mark off holes where the blood of the animals, sacrificed to assuage the hunger of the gods, would have drained away.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 12.1088px; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">In Mesopotamia, spirits bearing vessels spouting streams of water were the acolytes of Enki/Ea, the god of the Abyss and of fresh water. The fact that they figure in this work reflects the extent of the influence of Mesopotamian mythology in Susa. Here, they are associated with another Chtonian symbol, the snake, often found in Iranian iconography. The sinuous lines of the serpents resemble the winding course of a stream. It is thought that temples imitated the way streams well up from underground springs by the clever use of underground channels. Water - the precious liquid - was at the heart of Mesopotamian religious practice, being poured out in libations or used in purification rites.</p>
<p style=""font-size: 12.1088px; font-family: Arial, Verdana, Helvetica, sans-serif;"">Under Untash-Napirisha, the founder of the Igihalkid Dynasty, the Elamite kingdom flourished. He founded a new religious capital, Al-Untash - modern-day Chogha Zanbil - some 40 kilometers southeast of Susa. However, the project was short-lived. His successors soon brought large numbers of religious objects back to Susa, the former capital. This table was certainly among them. Its large size and clever drainage system reflect the remarkable achievements of metalworking at the time.</p>",Bronze,,

He was descended, through his mother, from the powerful and historically influential Alcmaeonid family.<br /><br />Pericles had such a profound influence on Athenian society that Thucydides, a contemporary historian, acclaimed him as ""the first citizen of Athens"". Pericles turned the Delian League into an Athenian empire, and led his countrymen during the first two years of the Peloponnesian War. The period during which he led Athens, roughly from 461 to 429 BC, is sometimes known as the ""Age of Pericles"", though the period thus denoted can include times as early as the Persian Wars, or as late as the next century. Pericles promoted the arts and literature; it is principally through his efforts that Athens holds the reputation of being the educational and cultural center of the ancient Greek world. He started an ambitious project that generated most of the surviving structures on the Acropolis (including the Parthenon). This project beautified and protected the city, exhibited its glory, and gave work to the people. Pericles also fostered Athenian democracy to such an extent that critics call him a populist.</p>

He was trained in Argos and then worked in Athens at the time of the Peloponnesian war, as a follower of the idealistic portraiture of Myron. He is best known for his statue Pericles with the Corinthian helmet.<br />Kresilas hailed from the city-state of Kydonia, on the island of Crete. He was trained in Argos as a student of Dorotheos, with whom he worked at Delphi and Hermione. Between 450 and 420 BC he worked mainly in Athens, as a follower of Myron's school and in the post-Phidias period he brought elements of compactness due to the Peloponnesian period.<br />Roman writer Pliny the Elder wrote of a competition between the four sculptors Polykleitos, Phidias, Kresilas, and Phradmon, on the best statues of Amazons for the Temple of Artemis at Ephesus. Each sculptor placed himself at first place, but Phidias, Kresilas, and Phradmon had all put Polykleitos at second place, thus, Polykleitos won, Pheidias came second, and Kresilas third. <br /><br /></p>

<p>&nbsp;An angel, especially according to Abrahamic religions and Zoroastrianism[citation needed], is a spiritual being superior to humans in power and intelligence. Angels are typically described as benevolent, dreadful, and endowed with wisdom and knowledge of earthly events, but not infallible; for they strive with each other, and God has to make peace between them.[3] Most of them serve either as intermediaries between Heaven and Earth, or as guardian spirits.[2][4] They are studied in the theological doctrine of angelology. In Christian Science, the word ""angel"" is used to refer to an inspiration from God. The use of the term has extended to refer to artistic depictions of the spirits, and it is also used figuratively to refer to messengers and harbingers, and to people who possess high qualities of goodness, purity, selflessness, intelligence, and/or beauty.<br /><br />Angels are referred to in connection with their spiritual missions; as for instance, the ""angel which has redeemed"", ""an interpreter"", ""the angel that destroyed"", ""the messenger of the covenant"", ""angel of his presence"", and ""a band of angels of evil"".<br /><br />In fine art, angels are usually depicted as having the shape of human beings of extraordinary beauty; they are often identified using the symbols of bird wings, halos, and light.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Publius Vergilius Maro (Classical Latin: [ˈpuː.blɪ.ʊs wɛrˈɡɪ.lɪ.ʊs ˈma.roː]; traditional dates October 15, 70 BC &ndash; September 21, 19 BC), usually called Virgil or Vergil /ˈvɜːrdʒᵻl/ in English, was an ancient Roman poet of the Augustan period. He is known for three acclaimed works of Latin literature, the Eclogues (or Bucolics), the Georgics, and the epic Aeneid. A number of minor poems, collected in the Appendix Vergiliana, are sometimes attributed to him.<br /><br />Virgil is traditionally ranked as one of Rome's greatest poets. His Aeneid has been considered the national epic of ancient Rome from the time of its composition to the present day. Modeled after Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, the Aeneid follows the Trojan refugee Aeneas as he struggles to fulfill his destiny and arrive on the shores of Italy&mdash;in Roman mythology the founding act of Rome. Virgil's work has had wide and deep influence on Western literature, most notably Dante's Divine Comedy, in which Virgil appears as Dante's guide through hell and purgatory.</p>

Known as the ""bulwark of the Achaeans"", he was trained by the centaur Chiron (who had trained Ajax' father Telamon and Achilles' father Peleus and would later die of an accidental wound inflicted by Heracles, whom he was at the time training), at the same time as Achilles. He was described as fearless, strong and powerful but also with a very high level of combat intelligence. Ajax commands his army wielding a huge shield made of seven cow-hides with a layer of bronze. Most notably, Ajax is not wounded in any of the battles described in the Iliad, and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive substantial assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles, although, in book 13, Poseidon strikes Ajax with his staff, renewing his strength. Unlike Diomedes and Achilles, Ajax appears as a mainly defensive warrior, instrumental in the defence of the Greek camp and ships and that of Patroclus' body. When the Trojans are on the offensive, he is often seen covering the retreat of the Achaeans. Significantly, while one of the deadliest heroes in the whole poem, Ajax has no aristeia depicting him on the offensive.</p>
<p><span class=""navtext2"">Ajax, or A&icirc;as (Of the earth) son of Telamon, king of Salamis, a legendary hero of ancient Greece. To distinguish him from Ajax, son of Oileus, he was called ""Ajax the Great"" or ""Telamonian Ajax"". In Homer's Iliad he is described as of great stature and colossal frame, second only to Achilles in strength and bravery, and the 'bulwark of the Achaeans'. He is not wounded in any of the battles described in the Iliad, and he is the only principal character on either side who does not receive personal assistance from any of the gods who take part in the battles.<br /> <br /> During the Trojan War, Ajax fought Hector while Achilles sulked over an argument with Agamemnon. Ajax wounded but did not kill him. He did kill Phorcys. During the fight over the body of Patroclus, his prayer to the gods to clear the fog which has descended over the battle is promptly granted by Zeus. In Homer's Odyssey, with the aid of Athena, Ajax rescued the body of Achilles from the hands of the Trojans. In the competition between him and Odysseus for the armour of Achilles, Agamemnon, at the instigation of Athena, awarded the prize to Odysseus. This so enraged Ajax that it caused his death (Odyssey, xi. 541). According to a later and more detailed story, his disappointment drove him mad; he rushed out of his tent and fell upon the flocks of sheep in the camp under the impression that they were the Trojan enemy; on coming to his senses, in shame he killed himself with the sword which he had received as a present from Hector. This is the account of his death given in the Ajax of Sophocles; in Pindar's ""Nemea"", 7; and in Ovid, Metamorphoses, xiii. 1). From his blood sprang a red flower, as at the death of Hyacinthus, which bore on its leaves the initial letters of his name Ai, also expressive of lament (Pausanias i. 35. 4). His ashes were deposited in a golden urn on the Rhoetean promontory at the entrance of the Hellespont.<br /> <br /> Like Achilles; he is represented as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the Danube (Pausanias iii. 19. 11). Ajax, who in the post-Homeric legend is described as the grandson of Aeacus and the great-grandson of Zeus, was the tutelary hero of the island of Salamis, where he had a temple and an image, and where a festival called Aianteia was celebrated in his honour (Pausanias i. 35). At this festival a couch was set up, on which the panoply of the hero was placed, a practice which recalls the Roman lectisternium. The identification of Ajax with the family of Aeacus was chiefly a matter which concerned the Athenians, after Salamis had come into their possession, on which occasion Solon is said to have inserted a line in the Iliad (book ii. 557 or 558), for the purpose of supporting the Athenian claim to the island. Ajax then became an Attic hero; he was worshipped at Athens, where he had a statue in the market-place, and the tribe Aiantis was called after his name.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Sophocles (/ˈsɒfəkliːz/; Greek: &Sigma;&omicron;&phi;&omicron;&kappa;&lambda;ῆ&sigmaf;, Sophoklēs, Ancient Greek: [so.pʰo.klɛ̂ːs]; c. 497/6 &ndash; winter 406/5 BC) is one of three ancient Greek tragedians whose plays have survived. His first plays were written later than those of Aeschylus, and earlier than or contemporary with those of Euripides. Sophocles wrote 120 plays during the course of his life, but only seven have survived in a complete form: Ajax, Antigone, The Women of Trachis, Oedipus the King, Electra, Philoctetes and Oedipus at Colonus. For almost 50 years, Sophocles was the most celebrated playwright in the dramatic competitions of the city-state of Athens that took place during the religious festivals of the Lenaea and the Dionysia. He competed in 30 competitions, won 18, and was never judged lower than second place. Aeschylus won 14 competitions, and was sometimes defeated by Sophocles, while Euripides won 5 competitions. <br /><br />The most famous tragedies of Sophocles feature Oedipus and also Antigone: they are generally known as the Theban plays, although each play was actually a part of a different tetralogy, the other members of which are now lost. Sophocles influenced the development of the drama, most importantly by adding a third actor, thereby reducing the importance of the chorus in the presentation of the plot. He also developed his characters to a greater extent than earlier playwrights such as Aeschylus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;A bust is a sculpted or cast representation of the upper part of the human figure, depicting a person's head and neck, and a variable portion of the chest and shoulders. The piece is normally supported by a plinth. These forms recreate the likeness of an individual. These may be of any medium used for sculpture, such as marble, bronze, terracotta or wood. A parallel term, aust, is a representation of the upper part of an animal or mythical creature.<br /><br />Sculptural portrait heads from classical antiquity are sometimes displayed as busts. However, these are often fragments from full-body statues, or were created to be inserted into an existing body;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>-- Who is depicted? </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term ""philosopher"" comes from the Ancient Greek (philosophos) meaning ""lover of wisdom"". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ariadne (Latin: Ariadne), in Greek mythology, was the daughter of Minos, King of Crete, Son of Zeus and his queen Pasipha&euml;, daughter of Helios. She is mostly associated with mazes and labyrinths because of her involvement in the myths of the Minotaur and Theseus. Her father put her in charge of the labyrinth where sacrifices were made as part of reparations (either to Poseidon or to Athena, depending on the version of the myth); later, she helped Theseus overcome the Minotaur and save the potential sacrificial victims. In other stories, she became the bride of the god Dionysus, with the question of her being mortal or a goddess varying in those accounts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Marcus Junius Brutus (85 BC &ndash; 23 October 42 BC), often referred to as Brutus, was a politician of the late Roman Republic. After being adopted by his uncle he used the name Quintus Servilius Caepio Brutus, but eventually returned to using his original name. He took a leading role in the assassination of Julius Caesar.</p>

Now only the head remains, broken off at the neck. Most of the front half of the man's head&nbsp;is broken as well.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Portraits of the hellenistic era were often idealised as they were designed for propaganda for a powerful figure rather than depicting accurate likenesses. But this man emerges strongly as an individual; he appears to be a mature man, perhaps late middle aged with short wavy hair and a closely trimmed beard. He has wide, rather fleshy cheeks, a square jaw and a bump in his nose, looking as if it had been broken at some time in his life. His brow is furrowed and his lips are tightly compressed giving him a tough, determined expression.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The only features that are not shown in lifelike detail are the eyes, which stare out vacantly. These, no doubt,&nbsp;would have been coloured once. We don't know who this man was. The large size of the head suggests the sculpture was part of a public monument, so he was certainly an imminant figure . He doesn't wear a crown , so he can't have been a ruler when the statue was&nbsp;erected. He does have a very regal bearing though, &nbsp;so he may well have been a member of a socratic or royal family.</p>",Marble,,

Gudea ruled between ca. 2144 - 2124 BC and the statues demonstrate a very sophisticated level of craftsmanship for the time.&nbsp;</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The statues were to represent the ruler in temples, to offer a constant prayer in his stead; offerings were made to these. Most of the statues bear an inscribed dedication explaining to which god it was dedicated. Gudea is either sitting or standing; in one case (N), he holds a water-jug au vase jaillissant. He normally wears a close fitting <a title=""Kaunakes"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaunakes"">kaunakes</a>, maybe made of sheep-skin, and a long tasseled dress. Only in one example (M, Soclet-statue) he wears a different dress, reminiscent of the Akkadian royal costume (torso of <a title=""Manishtushu"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manishtushu"">Manishtushu</a>). On the lap of one of them (statue B) is the plan of his palace, with the scale of measurement attached. Statue F is similar to statue B; both are missing their heads, and have on their lap a board with a measuring scale and a stylus, only statue F doesn't have a ground plan.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">It seems that the early statues are small and made of more local stones (<a title=""Limestone"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limestone"">limestone</a>, <a title=""Steatite"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steatite"">steatite</a> and <a title=""Alabaster"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alabaster"">alabaster</a>); later, when wide-ranging trade-connections had been established, the more costly exotic <a title=""Diorite"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diorite"">diorite</a> was used. Diorite had already been used by old Sumerian rulers (Statue of <a title=""Entemena"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entemena"">Entemena</a>). According to the inscriptions, the diorite&nbsp;came from <a title=""Majan (civilization)"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majan_(civilization)"">Magan</a>. The remnants of a very large diorite statue in the <a title=""British Museum"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Museum"">British Museum</a> may be a representation of Gudea, but this cannot be determined with certainty. What remains of the statue is 1.5m high (and weighs over 1250&nbsp;kg), meaning that if it was fully reconstructed the statue would be well over 3 metres high and the largest yet discovered sculpture of the ruler.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The dedication of the diorite statues normally tell how <a title=""Ens&iacute;"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ens%C3%AD"">ensi</a> Gudea had diorite brought from the mountains of Magan, formed it as a statue of himself, called by name to honour god/goddess (x) and had the statue brought into the temple of (y).

During his reign, the Empire defeated a revitalized Parthian Empire in the East: Aurelius&rsquo; general Avidius Cassius sacked the capital Ctesiphon in 164 AD. In central Europe, Aurelius fought the Marcomanni, Quadi, and Sarmatians with success during the Marcomannic Wars, although the threat of the Germanic tribes began to represent a troubling reality for the Empire. A revolt in the East led by Avidius Cassius failed to gain momentum and was suppressed immediately. (ref Wikipedia)</p>

A competition was held for which seven entrants submitted trial reliefs of The Sacrifice of Isaac. Lorenzo Giberti's entry was chosen in preference to that of his nearest rival, Filippo Brunelleschi. On 23 November 1403, the contract for the door was allotted to Ghiberti and his father, Bartolo di Michele, and the door was executed between 1403 and 1424. The format was intended to harmonize with that of the earlier door, comprising a similar scheme of twenty-eight panels, each containing a quatre-foil. The twenty upper reliefs containing scenes from the New Testament, and the eight lower panels containing single figures of the Evangelists and Church Fathers, complement Andrea Pisano's scheme of twenty scenes from the life of St John the Baptist above eight figures of Virtues. Ghiberti slightly altered the proportions of the panels, and replaced Andrea Pisano's dividing lattice of studs and rosettes with a rich foliate ornament. On Easter Sunday (19 April) 1424, the doors were set up at the East entrance to the Baptistry, facing the Cathedral. In 1452, they were moved to their present location, the North Entrance, when they were supplanted by Ghiberti's second bronze door, the Gates of Paradise.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">This original relief was from the north doors, which&nbsp;served as a votive offering to celebrate the sparing of Florence from relatively recent scourges such as the <a title=""Black Death"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Death"">Black Death</a> in 1348.

At the time of judging, only Ghiberti and Brunelleschi were finalists, and when the judges could not decide, they were assigned to work together on them. Brunelleschi's pride got in the way, and he went to Rome to study architecture leaving Ghiberti to work on the doors himself. Ghiberti's autobiography, however, claimed that he had won, ""without a single dissenting voice."" The original designs of The Sacrifice of Isaac by <a title=""Lorenzo Ghiberti"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorenzo_Ghiberti"">Ghiberti</a> and <a title=""Filippo Brunelleschi"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Brunelleschi"">Brunelleschi</a> are on display in the museum of the <a title=""Bargello"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bargello"">Bargello</a>.</p>

The eight lower panels show the four evangelists and the Church Fathers Saint Ambrose, Saint Jerome, Saint Gregory and Saint Augustine.

Her portrait was appropriated by the Nazi regime as a counter-image to so-called ""degenerate art""; it appeared as an ""Aryan"" role model in Fritz Hippler's film The Eternal Jew and as a SS cult object in World War II propaganda <br /><br />The statue possibly inspired the character of the Evil Queen in Disney's 1937 animated film Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs.

He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.<br /><br />John used baptism as the central symbol or sacrament of his messianic movement. Most scholars agree that John baptized Jesus. Scholars generally believe Jesus was a follower or disciple of John and several New Testament accounts report that some of Jesus' early followers had previously been followers of John. John the Baptist is also mentioned by the Jewish historian Josephus. Some scholars maintain that John was influenced by the semi-ascetic Essenes, who expected an apocalypse and practiced rituals corresponding strongly with baptism, although no direct evidence substantiates this.<br /><br />According to the New Testament, John anticipated a messianic figure greater than himself.

He is best known for a series of idealized busts of women, many made for the court in Naples. They are among the most arresting portraits of the Renaissance, and the most mysterious. Scholars disagree about how many and which ones were actually carved by Laurana. The identities of the sitters also provoke debate. Only two are named by inscriptions, including this one of Beatrice of Aragon (the other is Battista Sforza).<br /><br />Beatrice was a daughter of Ferdinand (Ferrante), who succeeded Alfonso as the king of Naples. Her portrait is likely to have been made about the time of her marriage, in 1476, to Matthias Corvinus, the king of Hungary. Like all Laurana&rsquo;s female portraits, Beatrice&rsquo;s image is highly idealized, almost to the point of abstraction. Her cool remoteness is accentuated by lowered eyes, delicate, even attenuated, features, and the smoothness of the carved surfaces. This extreme refinement, which subsumes individuality into elegance, makes the identification of unnamed sitters very difficult. Laurana also created male portraits, though apparently far fewer. Interestingly, they are all highly individualized. The blemish-free perfection of the women reflects a Renaissance ideal that equated female beauty and virtue (see Picturing Family and Friends).<br /><br />Originally this bust would have included color on the hair and dress. Many Renaissance marble sculptures were painted, but few retain more than scant traces of pigment.</p>",Marble,,

Considered to be the greatest living artist during his lifetime, he has since been described as one of the greatest artists of all time. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his rival and fellow Florentine Medici client, Leonardo da Vinci.<br /><br />A number of Michelangelo's works of painting, sculpture, and architecture rank among the most famous in existence. His output in every field of interest was prodigious; given the sheer volume of surviving correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences taken into account, he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century.<br /><br />He sculpted two of his best-known works, the Piet&agrave; and David, before the age of thirty. Despite holding a low opinion of painting, Michelangelo also created two of the most influential frescoes in the history of Western art: the scenes from Genesis on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome, and The Last Judgment on its altar wall. As an architect, Michelangelo pioneered the Mannerist style at the Laurentian Library. At the age of 74, he succeeded Antonio da Sangallo the Younger as the architect of St. Peter's Basilica. Michelangelo transformed the plan so that the western end was finished to his design, as was the dome, with some modification, after his death.<br /><br /></p>",Cast of the Marble original,,

His early education was overseen by the Emperor Hadrian, and he was later adopted by the Emperor Antoninus Pius in 138 C.E.. After an initial education in rhetoric undertaken by Fronto, Marcus later abandoned it in favor of philosophy. Marcus became Emperor himself in AD 161, initially alongside Lucius Verus, becoming sole Emperor in AD 169. Continual attacks meant that much of his reign was spent on campaign, especially in central Europe. However, he did find time to establish four Chairs of Philosophy in Athens, one for each of the principal philosophical traditions (Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, andEpicurean). He died in AD 180.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Marcus' reputation as a philosopher rests upon one work, the <em>Meditations</em>. The <em>Meditations</em> take the form of a personal notebook and were probably written while Marcus was on campaign in central Europe, <em>c.</em> AD 171-175. The entries appear to be in no particular order and may simply be in the original order of composition. The repetition of themes and the occasional groups of quotations from other authors (see e.g. <em>Med.</em> 4.46, 11.33-39)add to this impression. Book One, however, is somewhat different from the rest of the text and may well have been written separately (a plan for it may be discerned in <em>Med.</em> 6.48).</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">The first recorded mention of the <em>Meditations</em> is by Themistius in AD 364. The current Greek title - <em>ta eis heauton</em> ('to himself') &ndash; derives from a manuscript now lost and may be a later addition (it is first recorded <em>c.</em> AD 900 by Arethas). The modern text derives primarily from two sources: a manuscript now in the Vatican and a lost manuscript (mentioned above), upon which the first printed edition (1558) was based.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Beyond the <em>Meditations</em> there also survives part of a correspondence between Marcus and his rhetoric teacher Fronto, probably dating from earlier in Marcus' life (<em>c.</em> AD 138-166), discovered as a palimpsest in 1815. However, although this interesting discovery sheds some light on Marcus as an individual, it adds little to our understanding of his philosophy.</p>",Marble,,

Although Italica near Santiponce (in modern-day Spain) is often considered his birthplace, his actual place of birth remains uncertain. However, it is generally accepted that he came from a family with centuries-old roots in Hispania. His predecessor, Trajan, was a maternal cousin of Hadrian's father. Trajan did not officially designate an heir, but according to his wife Pompeia Plotina, Trajan named Hadrian emperor immediately before his death.

Under Nero, he was a member of the imperial entourage and played a vital part in exposing the Pisonian conspiracy of 65. Later, as a loyalist to the Flavians, he attained consulships in 71 and 90 during the reigns of Vespasian and Domitian respectively.<br /><br />On 18 September 96, Domitian was assassinated in a palace conspiracy involving members of the Praetorian Guard and several of his freedmen. On the same day, Nerva was declared emperor by the Roman Senate. This was the first time the Senate elected a Roman Emperor. As the new ruler of the Roman Empire, he vowed to restore liberties which had been curtailed during the autocratic government of Domitian.<br /><br />Nerva's brief reign was marred by financial difficulties and his inability to assert his authority over the Roman army. A revolt by the Praetorian Guard in October 97 essentially forced him to adopt an heir. After some deliberation Nerva adopted Trajan, a young and popular general, as his successor. After barely fifteen months in office, Nerva died of natural causes on 27 January 98. Upon his death he was succeeded and deified by Trajan.<br /><br />Although much of his life remains obscure, Nerva was considered a wise and moderate emperor by ancient historians. Nerva's greatest success was his ability to ensure a peaceful transition of power after his death, thus founding the Nerva&ndash;Antonine dynasty.</p>",Marble,,

Holes along the upper edge of the forehead, in the earlobes, in the hairstyle and on the sides of the neck were used to insert jewellery and precious fabrics to adorn the statue.</p>
<p>The goddess was probably seated on a throne, like small votive terracottas found in sanctuaries in Greece and Magna Graecia. Stylistic comparisons allow us to date the sculpture to the decade of 480-470 B.C. The head has been identified as Aphrodite or Persephone, perhaps from Locri Epizefiri, like the Ludovisi Throne (also available on Scan the World).</p>
<p>Both pieces were brought to Rome after the conquest of southern Italy to decorate the temple of Venus Erycina on the Quirinal Hill, in the same area where the&nbsp;<em>Horti Sallustiani&nbsp;</em>and, later, the Villa Ludovisi were located.</p>",Marble,,

<p>Power, tradition and propaganda. Augustus, the first emperor, also presented himself as the Pontiflex Maximum, the highest religious authority from the times of the first kings of Rome to the Republican period: the past exploited to legitimise power. As would happen many other times in history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This large marble sculpture was given its name after being found in the Via Labicana, an ancient road of Italy leading east-southeast from Rome. The road entered Rome through the Aurelian walls via the ancient monumental gate of Porta Prenestina where the sculpture could have originated from.</p>
<p>The sculpture is also known as Augustus as The Pontifex Maximus, the high priest of the College of Pontiffs in Ancient Rome. The Pontifex Maximum was the most important position in the ancient Roman religion, open only to patricians until 245 BC, when a plebeian first occupied the post. A distinctly religious office under the early Roman Republic, it gradually became politicized until, beginning with Augustus, it was subsumed into the Imperial office. After Julius Caesar&acute;s assassination in 44 BC and Marcus Aemlilius Lepidus&acute;s political exile, Augustus was given the roint to appoint other pontifices which lead to the creation of this sculpture.</p>
<p>It is a significant statue because it adds another aspect to Augustus&acute;self-representation; not only is he the politcal head of the Roman Empire, he is also the religious head of it. In the Rae Gestae 19-20 he talks about all of his religious benefactions to the city of Rome, such as building temples for ""Minerva, Queen Juno and Jupiter Libertas"".</p>
<p>Augustan representations in statue form are highly controlled to the extent that there are only three or four different subgroups; based on features such as the detail of the hairstyle this may be classified as one of the ""Prima Porta type"". As with all of Augustus&acute;statues he is depicted in an idealizing Greek style and as much younger than his actual age at the time, as opposed to the traditional Republican Roman portraiture, which is realist in its approach.</p>
<p>This is a bust variant of an other all full body sculpture of Augustus in the toga of The Pontifex Maximus, his head veiled and ready for a sacrifice. In the full sculpture he wears the calcei patricii (shoes reserved for Patricians), he extends his right arm to pour a libation, a cupsa (container for official documents) lies at his feet. This bust was scanned at the Casting Workshop of the Reunion des Musees Nationaux in Paris. The original sculpture is on permanent display in the Palazzo Massimo alle Terme at the National Museum of Rome.</p>

<p>This sphinx's original base has been calculated to have had a length of about 3.2 metres (10 feet 6 inches), dimensions that are not matched by any other preserved granite sphinx among the Hatshepsut sculptures. It is, therefore, quite possible that this royal beast was not one of a pair but stood on its own somewhere in the vast courts of the temple. The wide-open eyes and thick, evenly arched brows are typical of a number of sphix sculptures from Dei el-Bahri. They are also seen in the Metropolitan Museum's better preserved granite sphinx, now exhibited by the Dendur temple.</p>

This female figure, which may represent Andromeda or Europa was acquired in 1855. It is the only original Antique sculpture in the R.A. collections. <br /><br />Despite weathering and losses, the figure retains an elegance and vitality characteristic of late Classical Greek sculpture. The clinging drapery reveals a softness of form that contrasts with the athletic ideal exhibited by earlier 5th-century sculpture. The lack of modelling on the back suggests that the figure was designed to stand in an architectural niche. <br /><br />Although widely attributed to Timotheus, some scholars have argued that the sculpture is a Roman copy of a Greek original. It was greatly admired by Victorian Classicists such as Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema and others.&nbsp;</p>",Marble,,

<p>This work is considered a copy of the statue of Artemis created by Kephisodotos in the fourth century BC.&nbsp;From the Horti Vettiani (1873).</p>
<p>Artemis, in Greek religion, the goddess of wild animals, the hunt, and vegetation, and of chastity and childbirth; she was identified by the Romans with Diana (q.v.). Artemis was the daughter of Zeus and Leto and the twin sister of Apollo. Among the rural populace, Artemis was the favourite goddess. Her character and function varied greatly from place to place, but, apparently, behind all forms lay the goddess of wild nature, who danced, usually accompanied by nymphs, in mountains, forests, and marshes. Artemis embodied the sportsman&rsquo;s ideal, so besides killing game she also protected it, especially the young; this was the Homeric significance of the title Mistress of Animals.</p>

Caracalla reigned jointly with his father from 198 until Severus' death in 211. Caracalla then ruled jointly with his younger brother <a title=""Publius Septimius Geta"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publius_Septimius_Geta"">Geta</a>, with whom he had a fraught relationship, until he had Geta murdered later that year. Caracalla's reign was marked by domestic instability and external invasions from the Germanic people.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Caracalla's reign was notable for the <a title=""Antonine Constitution"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonine_Constitution"">Antonine Constitution,</a>&nbsp;also known as the Edict of Caracalla, which granted <a title=""Roman citizenship"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_citizenship"">Roman citizenship</a> to nearly all freemen throughout the <a title=""Roman Empire"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Empire"">Roman Empire</a>. The edict gave all the enfranchised men Caracalla's adopted <a title=""Praenomen"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praenomen"">praenomen</a> and <a title=""Roman naming conventions"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_naming_conventions"">nomen</a>: ""Marcus Aurelius"". Domestically, Caracalla was known for the construction of the <a title=""Baths of Caracalla"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baths_of_Caracalla"">Baths of Caracalla</a>, which became the second-largest baths in Rome, for the introduction of a new Roman currency named the <a title=""Antoninianus"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoninianus"">antoninianus</a>, a sort of double denarius, and for the massacres he enacted against the people of Rome and elsewhere in the empire. Towards the end of his rule, Caracalla began a campaign against the <a title=""Parthian Empire"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthian_Empire"">Parthian Empire</a>. He did not see this campaign through to completion due to his assassination by a disaffected soldier in 217. He was succeeded as emperor by <a title=""Macrinus"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macrinus"">Macrinus</a> after three days.</p>
<p style=""text-align: justify;"">Caracalla is presented in ancient sources as a tyrant and cruel leader, an image that has survived into modernity. <a title=""Dio Cassius"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dio_Cassius"">Dio Cassius</a> and <a title=""Herodian"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodian"">Herodian</a> present Caracalla as a soldier first and emperor second. In the 12th century, <a title=""Geoffrey of Monmouth"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_of_Monmouth"">Geoffrey of Monmouth</a> started the legend of Caracalla's role as the king of Britain. Later, in the 18th century, Caracalla's memory was revived in the works of French artists due to the parallels between Caracalla's apparent tyranny and that of <a title=""Louis XVI of France"" href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_XVI_of_France"">King Louis XVI</a>. Modern works continue to portray Caracalla as a psychopathic and evil ruler. His rule is remembered as being one of the most tyrannical of all Roman emperors.</p>",Marble from Luni,,

Roman portraits of women tend to be more idealized and less individualized than those of men. The political or social message that a portrait conveyed was as important as its actual resemblance to the person portrayed. For this reason, portraits of Roman women often are concerned more with representing the latest ideas of fashion and beauty than they are with depicting actual features.</p>",Marble from Luni,,

Previously unrecorded, it is the best version. The others are a painted plaster in the Museum of the Second Empire at the chateau of Compi&egrave;gne, France, and a partially stripped and repainted terracotta in the Carnavalet Museum, Paris. All were mold-made, but in this sculpture a few mold lines, almost as fine as human hairs, have been preserved. They are evidence of the precision and technical quality of this bust, the style of which may ultimately have been inspired by late sixteenth-century French sculptures such as Germain Pilon's renowned <em>Virgin of Sorrows</em> (marble example in Saint-Paul-Saint-Fran&ccedil;ois, Paris; terracotta in the Louvre), with its heavy veil.</p>
<p>At various junctures (1864 and 1870/1871 in Paris and Brussels; 1879 and 1882 at S&egrave;vres) Carrier-Belleuse employed Auguste Rodin (1840&ndash;1917) as an assistant. It was in Carrier-Belleuse's well-organized studios that Rodin learned how to manage the large-scale workshops of his maturity. Rodin probably also gained his mastery of mold-made sculptures from Carrier-Belleuse. The similarity between the two artists was a significant consideration in the purchase of this terracotta. The similarity of the National Gallery's Bust of a Woman, 1875, by Rodin, and Fantasy Bust by Carrier-Belleuse is easy to recognize.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the Gallery has acquired three large, nineteenth-century academic marble sculptures: <em>Nydia, the Blind Girl of Pompeii</em> by Randolph Rogers; <em>Reading Girl</em> by Pietro Magni; and <em>David Triumphant</em> by Thomas Crawford. The <em>Fantasy Bust</em> balances these works and, more significantly, provides a welcome link between them and Rodin. By contributing to a much-needed stylistic and historical context for the Gallery's sculptures by Rodin, the <em>Fantasy Bust of a Veiled Woman</em> also strengthens the chronological coherence of the collection.</p>",Terracotta,,

This change in style is attributed to Septimius's and Caracalla's North African heritage, and the former's military background.&nbsp;The Roman elite would often fashion private, personal portraits after the prevailing style of the reigning dynasties, and the present lot displays a deliberate imitation of the hair, beard and moustache sported by the ruling family of the early 3rd century A.D.

<p>Until the end of his reign, Augustus will be represented under this same image. In the last years of his life when he is over seventy-years-old, he will still appear as a man in the prime of his life, radiating with beauty. Like a god, the emperor does not age.</p>
<p>The source image of the imperial portrait that the emperor diffused throughout the Empire is one identified on the statue discovered in the villa of his wife Livia in Prima Porta near Rome. The meticulously crafted hairstyle is an element that allows specialist today to compare similar portraits and define the &ldquo;types&rdquo; or reference model to which the creation is generally related with a specific event. For example, in Augustus&rsquo;s bangs, we distinguish from left to right: two locks of hair coming from the left, an overlap formed by the crossing of the second lock with the central lock and, finally, a fork made up of the central lock and the following lock.</p>
<p>The date of this type of creation, supposedly from Prima Porta, should be estimated around 20 CE a few years after the Senate attributed Octavus with the name Augustus.</p>
<p>This prestigious title will be taken again by his successors and will finish by designating all of the emperors.</p>
<p>In this representation, the emperor wears an oak crown, also known as a civic crown, which symbolized supreme power. The Senate would have awarded him this crown after the battle of Actium in 31 CE, the moment of the defeat of Mark Anthony and Cleopatra and the restoration of peace.</p>",Marble,,

He founded a personal dynasty and converted the government into a military monarchy. His reign marks a critical stage in the development of the absolute despotism that characterized the later Roman Empire.</p>

It is believed to have been created around the 4th century BC.</p>
<p>The sitter of the sculpture&nbsp;is undetermined and has been subject to various interpretations both the academic and artistic circles. Most likely associated with the school of Kephisodotos in the early 4th Century BC&nbsp;the work can be considered to have been created at a similar time to that of The Apollo of Mantua (Louvre) which echoes the adrogynous subject and coiffure, albeit much more flamborant and elaborate.</p>
<p>Another bust, titled The Head of Apollo and part of the Ince Blundell collection of The Liverpool Museums, further echoes the style of this sculpture. The bust has almost exact similarities in its youthful male and feminine features, as well as the characterized thick ring of locks which sweep around the face into a topknot with loose ringlets falling onto the shoulders and nape of the neck. As the Blundell Apollo is in such clean condition, it is suspected that it is a copy of this bust&nbsp;of the Vatican Museum which inspired many 18th Century replicas. The sculpture has also been misidentified as a bust of Isis&nbsp;due to the over the brow lotus-like lock of hair, though this has been refuted.</p>
<p>Sculptures with similar styles include the Apollos at The British Museum and Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek and The Apollo Citharoedus.</p>

<p>The original sculpture (ORIG1129) that this cast was made can be found at the Pio Clementino Museum (Vatican Museums). The provenance of the original is not clear; it&nbsp;is presented as&nbsp;a full figure sculpture in the Vatican Museums though its head and body are actually of separate origin. The body is from an original of the fifth century BC whereas the head is a copy of a portrait of the late fifth or early fourth centry BC. The sculpture was&nbsp;initially&nbsp;thought to be that of Hermes, but was later decided to be of Phocion.</p>
<p>The combination of the head and body of the original sculpture must be a modern act as the two sculptures are catalogued as casts at The Statens Museum for Kunst: <a href=""http://collection.smk.dk/#/en/detail/KAS790"">Body</a> and <a href=""http://collection.smk.dk/#/en/detail/KAS2373"">Head</a>.</p>

The features of both deities are combined in this sculpture.</p>
<p>Worship of Amun, called Ammon by the Greeks, also spread north to the Greek peninsula, with statues and temples erected at Delphi, Sparta, Thebes, Aphytis, and Megalopoli. The poet Pindar wrote a hymn to Ammon, which was inscribed on a triangular pillar at Thebes, where Ammon came to become the principal local deity.</p>

<p>The head was originally mounted in Albani's collection on a torso of Bacchus which was soon exchanged for a head of Bacchus found by Gavin Hamilton. As described by Townley, ""A Head of Apollo larger than life. The hair is plaited over the forehead and tied in a knot behind. In the account book the head is described simply as 'a head of Apollo', and the same description was still used around 1781 (TY 12/1), but in the 'L' Catalogue of 1787-8, it was called 'Apollo Philesius' (TY 12/3). This description may be presumed to have appeared also in the fair copy of this catalogue, now in Towneley Hall, by the entry is concealed by a slip that has been pasted in, with a revised entry in Townley's hand designating the head as 'Apollo Iners', and repeating reference to Winckelmann, who 'speaks of this head, as a rare specimin of the sublime early style of Greek sculpture'.</p>
<p>It is believed to be from a sculpture of the&nbsp;Lyceus type, a style depicting Apollo originating from Praxiteles, which depicts the God resting on a support with his right forearm touching the top of his head. His hair is fixed in braids on top of a head typical of chilhood. Many sculptures follow this type and were used in later artworks, such as in the <a

The bust could depict Venus, as the craning of the head&nbsp;echoes the shape of the Aphrodite of Knidos or even The Crouching Venus, though this female turns her head to the right.</p>
<p>The original sculpture&nbsp;from what this cast was made originates from The Staatliche Antikensammlungen und Glyptothek (ORIG1507) though no record of this has been found yet. The work was also apparently mentioned in Furtw&auml;ngler 1900, No. 234, though this covers&nbsp;carved gemstones.</p>

<p>Originally considered to be a work by Nanni di Bartolo by&nbsp;Horst Waldemar Janson (Janson 1957 II, 228-31, Figs. 482a-84d), Donatello's signature is featured on its base (of the full figure sculpture).

<p>The Emperor Hadrian became obsessed with Antinous, a young man from Asia Minor, to the extent that the Emperor created a cult of Antinous when the young man died, in 130 CE.</p>
<p>Hadrian also loved Classical Greek sculpture, so had made a number of sculptures of the beautiful youth in the guise of various gods. Here we see Antinous as Dionysos the Greek wine god. The inspiration from fifth century BCE Greek sculpture is clear, although the added sense of brooding romance in this sculpture means it could never be mistaken for the work of Pheidias or the other High Classical masters.</p>
<p>The full-length figure was originally draped in bronze.</p>

<p>There were many equestrian statues in ancient Rome at the time of Marcus Aurelius' death. Late Imperial descriptions of the areas of the city listed 22 such statues, called equi magni, were of the same scale to sculptures such as this one. The statue of Marcus Aurelius is the only one to have survived to the present day, mostly thanks to its constant transferral between leaders up until 1538 when Pope Paul III ordered for it to be moved to the Capitoline Hill, which had become the head quarters of the city's authorities in 1143.</p>
<p>A year after its arrival, the Roman Senate commissioned Michelangelo to refurbish the statue. The great Florentine artist did not just limit himself to planning an appropriate site for the monument, but made it in central element to the magnificent architectural complex known as the Piazza del Campidoglio.</p>

It is situated on the south side of the&nbsp;River Arno, a short distance from the&nbsp;Ponte Vecchio. The core of the present&nbsp;palazzo&nbsp;dates from 1458 and was originally the town residence of&nbsp;Luca Pitti, an ambitious Florentine banker.</p>
<p>The palace was bought by the&nbsp;Medici family&nbsp;in 1549 and became the chief residence of the ruling families of the&nbsp;Grand Duchy&nbsp;of&nbsp;Tuscany. It grew as a great treasure house as later generations amassed paintings, plates, jewellery and luxurious possessions.</p>
<p>In the late 18th century, the palazzo was used as a power base by&nbsp;Napoleon, and later served for a brief period as the principal royal palace of the newly united Italy. The palace and its contents were donated to the Italian people by&nbsp;King Victor Emmanuel III&nbsp;in 1919.</p>
<p>The Palazzo is now the largest museum complex in Florence. The principal palazzo block, often in a building of this design known as the corps de logis, is 32,000 square meters. It is divided into several principal galleries or museums detailed below.</p>",,,

<p>Atoninus Pius had long favoured Marcus Aurelius in his reign of&nbsp;serving as emperor, producing several busts in various styles in his honour. This earled Chiragan one of its finest busts of Aurelius, created around 145 AD. The years 144-145 were very important for the young Marcus Aurelius; he was commissioned to be a second consulate and married Faustina, the daughter or Antoninus Pius. This marriage sealed Pius's choice to destine Aurelius to the Emptire.</p>
<p>A new bust was thus created from the original 'youthful' style of Marcus Aurelius portraits, slightly aging the sitter by adding a nascent beard and moustache as to&nbsp;usher the young Emperor into adolescence. The bust is very&nbsp;incricately produced, with a beautiful effect of drapery on the pilitary coat (paludamentum), fixed by a fibula flower on the right shoulder. The moustache and the beard, pushing scantily on the edges of his jaw,&nbsp;compliment a swollen mass of hair and abundantly hollowed and twisted curls. The iris of the eye is engraved and the pupil doubly punctuated, a feature soon to become canon in the conventional Roman portrait.</p>

It was discovered in the Villa of the Papyri in the ancient city of Herculaneum and is housed in the Museo Archaeologico Nazionale, Naples.</p>
<p>Considered one of the loveliest of bronze busts discovered from Herculaneum, its identity is still under consideration. The head does not resemble the busts usually accepted as portraits of Plato, and the style would seem to place it under a much earlier date than Plato. Both Furtwangler and Lenormant believe it to be an original of the fifth century.</p>
<p>The head, which came from a room south of the tablinum, seems once to have formed part of a statue. The first and delicate modelling of cheek and brow, and the technique of the whole work is a revelation of method. The very chisel-marks can be seen on the exquisitely finished beard, and on the thick hair, tucked up like that of the Lemnian Athena, with the broad fillet binding the brow and pressing into the abundant masses of hair.<br />As to the identification of the bust, it might well be the head of the god Dionysus, brooding upon the mysteries known only to the initiate, and revealed to the vulgar in the fierce ecstasies of the Bacchic revels.</p>
<p>Lenormant (a 19th-century French assyriologist and archaeologist), however, attributes to bust fo the great Dorian School, which flourished at Tarentum, and whence so many works of art found their way to Rome when the town was sacked by Fabius Maximus in BC 209. He further conjectures, with some probability, that it may represent a Poseidon, a deity especially venerated at Tarentum. Vase paintings and coins of Tarentum certainly show us Poseidons somewhat resembling this head.</p>

<p>The Farnese Hercules is a colossal marble statue, most likely a Roman copy of a much older Greek bronze from the fourth centuy BC. The enlarged version, now the most famed, was made for the Baths of Caracalla in Rome (dedicated in 216 AD) where the statue was recovered in 1546 and is now on display inthe Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples. The sculpture depicts a muscular, yet weary, Hercules leaning on his club, which has the skin of the Nemean lion draped over it. In myths about Hercules, killing the lion was his first task. He has just perfomed one of the last of The Twelve Labours, which is suggested by the apples of the Hesperides he holds behind his back.</p>

He acquired the name Pius after his accession to the throne, either because he compelled the Senate to deify his adoptive father Hadrian, or because he had saved senators sentenced to death by Hadrian in his later years.</p>
<p>His reign is notable for the peaceful state of the Empire, with no major revolts or military incursions during this time, and for his governing without ever leaving Italy. A successful military campaign in southern Scotland early in his reign resulted in the construction of the Antonine Wall. Antoninus was an effective administrator, leaving his successors a large surplus in the treasury, expanding free access to drinking water throughout the Empire, encouraging legal conformity, and facilitating the enfranchisement of freed slaves.</p>

His father was of senatorial rank and was a first cousin of the emperor Trajan. Early in Hadrian's career, before Trajan became emperor, he married Trajan's grand-niece Vibia Sabina, possibly at the behest of Trajan's wife, Pompeia Plotina. Plotina and Trajan's close friend and adviser Licinius Sura were well disposed towards Hadrian. When Trajan died, his widow claimed that immediately before his death, he had nominated Hadrian as emperor.</p>
<p>Rome's military and Senate approved Hadrian's succession, but soon after, four leading senators who had opposed Hadrian, or seemed to threaten his succession, were unlawfully put to death; the senate held Hadrian responsible for this, and never forgave him. He earned further disapproval among the elite by abandoning Trajan's expansionist policies and recent territorial gains in Mesopotamia, Assyriaand Armenia, and parts of Dacia. Hadrian preferred to invest in the development of stable, defensible borders, and the unification, under his overall leadership, of the empire's disparate peoples. He is known for building Hadrian's Wall, which marked the northern limit of Britannia.</p>
<p>Hadrian energetically pursued his own Imperial ideals and personal interests. He visited almost every province of the Empire, accompanied by a probably vast Imperial retinue of specialists and administrators. He encouraged military preparedness and discipline, and fostered, designed or personally subsidised various civil and religious institutions and building projects. In Rome itself, he rebuilt or completed the Pantheon, and constructed the vast Temple of Venus and Roma. In Egypt, he may have rebuilt the Serapeum of Alexandria. An ardent admirer of Greece, he sought to make Athensthe cultural capital of the Empire and ordered the construction of many opulent temples there. His intense relationship with the Greek youth Antinous and the latter's untimely death led to Hadrian's establishment of an enduring and widespread popular cult. Late in his reign, he suppressed the Bar Kokhba revolt in Judaea; with this major exception, Hadrian's reign was generally peaceful.</p>",,,

His poems can also, however, seem difficult and even peculiar. The Athenian comic playwright Eupolis once remarked that they ""are already reduced to silence by the disinclination of the multitude for elegant learning"". Some scholars in the modern age also found his poetry perplexing, at least until the 1896 discovery of some poems by his rival Bacchylides; comparisons of their work showed that many of Pindar's idiosyncrasies are typical of archaic genres rather than of only the poet himself. His poetry, while admired by critics, still challenges the casual reader and his work is largely unread among the general public.</p>

In the Antonine period, elaborate coiffures such as this one were fashionable among the jeunesse dorée. The two portraits of the emperor Lucius Verus, demonstrate the deeply drilled carving style that was developed in Rome to convey the light and dark effects within such curls. Greek sculptors sought a more plastic rendering; each lock on this head varies and ends with an individualized snail-like curl. Not only fashionable, the full head of hair, the sharp turn of the head, nude chest, casually draped cloak, and ribbon-like sword belt all evoked associations with images of the Homeric heroes and the glorious past of Classical Greece.

<p>Cook 2011, nr. 158:<br />‘A bust, resembling the medals of Gordianus Africanus, the father; it is draped with the Toga, and ornamented with the Latus Clavus; the hair is marked by points, corresponding to the style of sculpture at the time. it was found about the year 1770 near [blank] along with a fine bust of Comodus, purchased by Cardinal Alex: Albani, and placed by him in his villa near Rome’ (TY 12/3; B. F. Cook, `The Townley Marbles in Westminster and Bloomsbury', The British Museum Yearbook, 2 (1977), 42-43, figs. 24-25, no. 28).<br />Although Townley occasionally appears to identify this bust definitely as Gordianus Africanus, he does so only in catalogue headings and in lists consisting of very short descriptions (TY 10/6-7, TY 12/6). In slightly less restricted spaces, he identifies the bust by the manner in which the toga is worn, with the latus clavus (TY12/5, TY 12/2), and in more extended contexts tends to refer to a mere resemblance to the coins of Gordianus (TY 12/22/61/1). Although Townley himself seems to have harboured doubts about the identification, it was accepted by Smith. More recent scepticism (Felletti Maj, Wegner) confirms Townley’s perceptiveness.<br />GR 1 (bust 4) gives the provenance as near Rome, but Lyde Browne’s Catalogue (no. 1) specifies Roma Vecchia.<br />Bought from Lyde Browne, probably in July 1775, for £60 (TY 10/5-7; TY 12/1; TY 10/3, fo. 13).</p>",Marble,,

AD 30,bust,"<p>Tiberius (/taɪˈbɪəriəs/; Latin: Tiberius Caesar Divi Augusti filius Augustus; 16 November 42 BC – 16 March 37 AD) was the second Roman emperor, reigning from 14 AD to 37 AD, succeeding Augustus.</p>
<p>Born to Tiberius Claudius Nero and Livia Drusilla in a Claudian family, he was given the personal name Tiberius Claudius Nero. His mother divorced Nero and married Octavian—later to ascend to Emperor as Augustus—who officially became his stepfather. Tiberius would later marry Augustus' daughter (from his marriage to Scribonia), Julia the Elder, and even later be adopted by Augustus. Through the adoption, he officially became a Julian, assuming the name Tiberius Julius Caesar. The emperors after Tiberius would continue this blended dynasty of both families for the following thirty years; historians have named it the Julio-Claudian dynasty. His relationship to the other emperors of this dynasty was as follows: he was the stepson of Augustus, grand-uncle of Caligula, paternal uncle of Claudius, and great-grand uncle of Nero. Tiberius' 22-and-a-half-year reign would be the longest after that of Augustus until that of Antoninus Pius, who surpassed his reign by a few months.</p>
<p>Tiberius was one of the greatest Roman generals; his conquest of Pannonia, Dalmatia, Raetia, and (temporarily) parts of Germania, laid the foundations for the northern frontier. Even so, he came to be remembered as a dark, reclusive and sombre ruler who never really desired to be emperor; Pliny the Elder called him ""the gloomiest of men"". After the death of his son Drusus Julius Caesar in 23 AD, Tiberius became more reclusive and aloof. In 26 AD he removed himself from Rome and left administration largely in the hands of his unscrupulous Praetorian prefects Lucius Aelius Sejanus and Quintus Naevius Sutorius Macro. When Tiberius died, he was succeeded by his grand-nephew and adopted grandson, Caligula.</p>",Marble,,

He was the younger brother of Titus and the son of Vespasian, his two predecessors on the throne, and the last member of the Flavian dynasty. During his reign, the authoritarian nature of his rule put him at sharp odds with the senate, whose powers he drastically curtailed.</p>
<p>Domitian had a minor and largely ceremonial role during the reigns of his father and brother. After the death of his brother, Domitian was declared emperor by the Praetorian Guard. His 15-year reign was the longest since that of Tiberius. As emperor, Domitian strengthened the economy by revaluing the Roman coinage, expanded the border defenses of the empire, and initiated a massive building program to restore the damaged city of Rome. Significant wars were fought in Britain, where his general Agricolaattempted to conquer Caledonia (Scotland), and in Dacia, where Domitian was unable to procure a decisive victory against king Decebalus. Domitian's government exhibited strong authoritarian characteristics; he saw himself as the new Augustus, an enlightened despot destined to guide the Roman Empire into a new era of brilliance. Religious, military, and cultural propaganda fostered a cult of personality, and by nominating himself perpetual censor, he sought to control public and private morals. As a consequence, Domitian was popular with the people and army, but considered a tyrant by members of the Roman Senate.</p>
<p>Domitian's reign came to an end in 96 when he was assassinated by court officials. He was succeeded the same day by his advisor Nerva. After his death, Domitian's memory was condemned to oblivion by the Roman Senate, while senatorial authors such as Tacitus, Pliny the Younger, and Suetonius propagated the view of Domitian as a cruel and paranoid tyrant. Modern revisionists instead have characterized Domitian as a ruthless but efficient autocrat whose cultural, economic, and political programs provided the foundation of the peaceful second century.</p>

<p>Pietro Mellini was a rich Florentine merchant, several times prior and ally of the Medici house , who had commissioned, also from Benedetto da Maiano, also the pulpit of Santa Croce with Stories of Saint Francis . An inscription on the thickness of the marble recalls the name of the portrayed and the date 1474 .</p>
<p>Already belonged to Luigi Ricceri Campani, in 1825 it was bought by the Florentine Galleries (current Uffizi ) and during the nineteenth century, with the reorganization of the Medici collections, it passed to the National Museum established at the Bergello in 1865.</p>
<p>The bust is inspired by the ways of Antonio Rossellino and shows an old man portrayed with great meticulousness, even in the signs of age, according to that attitude to the realistic portrait that in those years also involved Domenico Ghirlandaio in painting . The expression, with tight lips and rippled forehead, betrays various emotions, ranging from a sense of skepticism to the watchful man's attention.</p>
<p>The dress, in fine brocatello , was treated with a virtuosistically soft modeling, where the arabesques of the decoration that sway and deform under the folds are perfectly legible. A flap of the dress is folded nonchalantly on the right shoulder.</p>
<p>The calibrated suspension between naturalism and composed idealisation is therefore typical of the sculptor (the references to Roman portraiture are evident ), combined with pieces of technical virtuosity that made him one of the most requested artists in the Florence of the time.</p>

Inscriptions on the marble bust in the Louvre confirm Filippo as the sitter and the Florentine sculptor Benedetto da Maiano as the artist. Benedetto appears to have routinely made terracotta models in preparation for his marble sculptures. The Louvre bust and its model, now in Berlin, represent the earliest surviving instance of a terracotta and the finished marble. Their juxtaposition provides insight into both the sculptor's working methods and the nature of fifteenth-century Florentine portrait sculpture.</p>
<p>In the terracotta bust, Filippo turns his head to the right. Peculiarities such as the mole beside the nose individualize his physiognomy. The body is disproportionate to the head, indicating that the two sections were modeled separately. The body was presumably a workshop piece, while the head would have been modeled by the master.</p>
<p>Where the terracotta model is concerned with capturing psychological expression, in the marble the artist paid greater attention to physiognomic and clothing details. Here, Filippo faces forward, his gaze just right of centre. His mature features confer a certain gravity of character. The enlarged torso is erect and imposing.</p>

In Greek Mythology, the story of Niobe’s children goes down in history as one of the most poignant stories ever to be told…</p>
<p>Niobe is the daughter of Tantalus (King of Sipylus), she gave birth to fourteen children (Niobids), seven sons and seven daughters, all fathered by Amphion (King of Thebes). At a ceremony held in honour of the Titan Leto, mother of Zeus’s divine twins Apollo (god of light and music) and Artemis (goddess of hunting and nature). Niobe boasted of her grander fertility and her children's incomparable beauty in front of Leto. As punishment for Niobe's pride and arrogance, the twins came down to Earth where Apollo killed all Niobe's sons and Artemis killed all her daughters. Before Apollo killed her last living son, Niobe pleaded that Apollo spare his life, which he did not.</p>
<p>Some versions of the tale believe that one of the daughters, Chloris and her brother Amyclas survived because they prayed to Leto. Chloris became the wife of Neleus (son of Poseidon) and the mother of Nestor who was given by Apollo all the years of life taken away from the Niobids. As for Amphion it is believed he was either so devastated by the loss of his children that he killed himself or that he was also killed by Apollo when trying to avenge his children’s deaths. Either way Niobe was so heartbroken that she went to Mount Sipylus and pleaded to the gods to end to her pain. Out of sympathy Zeus turned her, where even as a rock Niobe continued to cry endless tears creating a stream. It is said that no one buried the Niobids until the ninth day after their death, when the gods themselves entombed them as Zeus had also turned the people she ruled into stone.</p>",Plaster Cast,,

UPDATE: The stand is much thicker than in the images.</p>
<p>The Trojan War is estimated to have begun in either the 12th or 13th Century BC and is one of the most important events to happen in Greek mythology. It was sparked when Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband, Menelaus (King of Sparta) and ended in April 1184 BCE when the city of Troy were defeated by Greek armies. There have been many literature works that narrate the war, but the works known as Iliad and Odyssey by Homer from his 24 books are the most notable to date, making his work of great significance to Greek history and culture.</p>
<p>Iliad comes before Odyssey and focuses on the Greek warrior Achilles during the Trojan War. Achilles was the son of the mortal Peleus (King of the Myrmidons), and the sea nymph, Thetis. Although Iliad covers only a few weeks in the final year of the war, it suggests that many of the Greek legends about it are true. Odyssey comes after Iliad and recounts the heroic deeds of Odysseus (King of Ithaca) who wanders for 10 years trying to find his way home after the Trojan War although the poem only covers the last six weeks.</p>",Plaster Cast,,

<p>In the 3rd Century BC he founded Stoicism, the set of doctrines that are midway between the obsession with duty and the cynic’s rejection of society. If you’ve heard the phrase “man conquers the world by conquering himself” then you have heard one of Zeno’s quotes.</p>
<p>Like the cynics, Zeno recognised a simple good, rejecting all desires for wealth, power and fame and living with the bare necessities required to exist. But he also recognised the Stoics acceptance of Fate, that whatever happens, happens, and there is no point in complaining about it. He lectured his students on the value of apatheia – the absence of passion, arguing that only by controlling one’s emotions and physical desires could one develop wisdom and apply it.</p>
<p>Stoicism dominated the Roman and Hellenistic periods and even went on to influence Christianity. None of Zeno’s own works have survived to modern era, all that is known about him, is known from his followers and critics.</p>

They were both picked out as young boys by the past Emperor Hadrian to be the then-reinging-emperor Antoninus’s successors, just as Antoninus was Hadrian’s adopted successor. They were the first co-emperors to rule Rome, despite the senate plans for Marcus to rule alone, to which Marcus refused unless Lucius received equal powers. They ruled together well which set an example for following Emperors to come.</p>
<p>Marcus controlled the city of Rome and the campaigns along the northern frontier whilst Lucius was responsible for gathering a massive army and setting out East. When Lucius and his troops returned to Rome, the city had been struck by a mass of the smallpox pandemic. The Romans believed that Lucius and his troops were the cause of the disease being released, that they had disturbed the temple of Apollo angering the god of Health and Diseases resulting in the disease being unleashed. Lucius succumbed to this disease ending his life, and some might say, ended the Roman Empire’s glory days. Marcus went on to rule solo until his son, Commodus, joined him in 177. Marcus died in 180.</p>

<p>Whether the hunchback is an original of its time or a copy of a now lost Greek work is still contentious. Since its discovery in the Baths of Caracalla, the figure has been identified as the famous Greek fabulist Aesop, who, according to literary tradition, may have been a hunchback.

The work was commissioned for the Duomo in Florence and was completed between 1423 - 1425.</p>
<p>The name, Zuccone, originates from the long and angular shape of the figure's head, translating to 'Pumpkin' in Italian. </p>
<p>The spectacularly life-like statue is fraught with tension and clad in the flowing robes that are typical of most of Donatello's prophets. His face is tilted slightly down which gives the figure a humble expression upon his gaunt face.</p>
<p>The legend of Habakkuk appears in the Hebrew bible. Very little information is revealed about the prophet. This allowed Donatello more artistic freedom then was typical with other statues that had more clearly defined histories. Habakkuk's legacy in text was slightly unusual in that he was one of the only prophets to question God and the injustices God allowed. Donatello must have been inspired by this information when he created his statue's melancholy and questioning eyes.</p>
<p>Lo Zuccone was reportedly one of Donatello's favorite pieces. Vasari would later recount Donatello's affection for the statue, stating that while he was working Donatello would stare at Zuccone's face muttering, ""Speak, damn you, speak!""</p>",Plaster,,

<p>The portrait belongs to the so-called ""first type"", known from about 25 copies and likely created right after AD 139, when the prince took the title of ""Caesar"".</p>
<p>Busts with paludamentum were in fashion and widespread from the Antonine period, while the use of a thin line to indicate the pupil without using a drill hole is peculiar. This youth portrait became the model for private portraits and for the official youth portraits of Caracalla (see <a href=""https://www.myminifactory.com/object/3d-print-portrait-of-caracalla-as-a-young-man-102540"">KAS1234</a>)</p>

The hair is arranged in a lively style with wavy locks that overlap each other on multiple planes and follow the outline of the skullcap; there are unruly locks on his forehead.</p>

It was originally believed to depict Seneca the Younger, the notable Roman philosopher, because its emaciated features were supposed to reflect his Stoic philosophy. However, modern scholars agree it is likely a fictitious portrait, likely intended for either Hesiod or Aristophanes. It is thought that the original example was a lost Greek bronze of ca. 200 BC. The bust is conserved in the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples.</p>
<p>""Pseudo-Seneca"" is also used for the uncertain authors of various antique and medieval texts such as De remediis fortuitorum, which purport to be by the Roman author. At least some of these seem to preserve and adapt genuine Senecan content, for example Saint Martin of Braga's (d. c. 580) Formula vitae honestae, or De differentiis quatuor virtutumvitae honestae (""Rules for an Honest Life"", or ""On the Four Cardinal Virtues""). Early Mss. preserve Martin's preface, where he makes it clear that this was his adaption, but in later copies this was omitted, and the work became thought fully Seneca's work.</p>
<p>Portraits of ancient worthies like this were once valued more because of who they represented than their artistic merit. This head was identified as Seneca from 1598 until 1813, when another portrait now in Berlin was found, inscribed with Seneca’s name but looking quite different.</p>
<p>Once it was established that this was not the Roman orator, poet and dramatist Seneca, art historians paid more attention to the portrait’s intrinsic qualities. That probably explains why this particular “pseudo-Seneca”, one of about forty similar copies, was largely unknown for nearly a century after its discovery.</p>
